# testREPO

The testREPO repository:
This repository was created for storing the Apiary output for the AdaptiveAPI documentation.  It is public, so that it can be accessible
to all members the adaptive project team.

The Adaptive API:
This API is intended to abstract 3rd party calls (whether external or internal) to adaptive learning engines.  It was written based on
what is currently needed for the Knewton integration and may need to be expanded to meet the needs of other adaptive engines.

The Apiary doc:
The "apiary.apib" file may be viewed with a text editor, but it is intended to be viewed via Apiary.  
To view/edit using Apiary:
1. go to "https://apiary.io/"
2. choose "Quick start with GitHub"
3. login to your GitHub account
4. In Apiary, go to "Settings"
5. Choose to link to the repository where the *.apib exists 
  a. (currently shudson/testREPO; in GitHub, search for repository "user:shudson01 testREPO").  
  b. If testREPO is being used, you may need to ask to be added as a collaborator.
  c. when linking to repository, choose to load existing blueprint; DO NOT overwrite.
6. In Apiary, use the drop down at the top left corner to choose or search for "adaptiveapi"
7. You should now be able to view or edit the adaptiveapi blueprint.
